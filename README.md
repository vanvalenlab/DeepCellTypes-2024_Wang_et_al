# DeepCell Types Publication Figure

This repo contains notebooks to reproduce the figures from Wang et al. (2024). 

The result figures only contain a subset of ExpandedTissueNet that includes all data sourced from public datasets. It is available at https://vanvalenlab.github.io/deepcell-types/. The remaining datasets were made available to our lab before their publication. These are available upon reasonable request and will be made publicly available upon publication of the corresponding manuscripts.
